# InsideOutExhibition
The Inside Out exhibition was developed as a thesis project during my final year as a master's student.
It was the result of collaboration between two research units at the University of Coimbra - the Dendrochronology Laboratory at the Centre for Functional Ecology (CFE) and the Computational Design and Visualization Lab (CDV) at the Centre of Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra (CISUC).

Problem: Share images of the wood anatomy of various tree species from the Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra (JBUC) with the general public. These images, which would previously only have been observed under a microscope, show unrivalled patterns in the growth rings that explain the structure and functioning of the anatomy.

Solution: Create an exhibition with two components: one physical and one digital. The first make it possible to analyse images of the wood's anatomy on panels located in the JBUC, while observing the tree itself. The second function as a website and its available to a greater number of people. Here it is possible to explore information on more tree species, as well as interact with the data itself through a visualization.
